sup, im Andrew, also known as thetrueduck420
my hobbies are coding and engineering, which are damn awesome
im pretty boring 
in addition to that im a pretty unlikeable guy and you sure as hell wouldnt wanna be my friend
on the internet im pretty nice sometimes
unless i dont have a good feeling about you, which is most people
so youre either gonna get blocked or ill leave you the most hateful message of your life


on the other hand im pretty affectionate if i see you as a good friend


sorry about that 7 line talk


anyways, i hope i can bring happiness to the world with my code
even if its just code
ill never release something to the public if its not open source and free
and if it is, feel free to dissasemble it and/or pirate it


im also pretty interested in video games
specifically violent or stuff with a lotta action
like hotline miami and neckbreak
it gives me dopamine and thats very enjoyable
you dont know how much i crave dopamine


anyways, that basically sums me up

have fun with whatever this is

make fun of me on social media

cya :3
